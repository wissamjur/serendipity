    "\n",
    "LightGCN is a simplified version of Neural Graph Collaborative Filtering (NGCF) [4], which adapts GCNs in recommendation systems.\n",
    "\n",
    "### 1.1 Graph Networks in Recommendation Systems\n",
    "\n",
    "GCN are networks that can learn patterns in graph data. They can be applied in many fields, but they are particularly well suited for Recommendation Systems, because of their ability to encode relationships.\n",
    "\n",
    "In traditional models like matrix factorization [5], user and items are represented as embeddings. And the interaction, which is the signal that encodes the behavior, is not part of the embeddings, but it is represented in the loss function, typically as a dot product. \n",
    "\n",
    "Despite their effectiveness, some authors [1,4] argue that these methods are not sufficient to yield satisfactory embeddings for collaborative filtering. The key reason is that the embedding function lacks an explicit encoding of the crucial collaborative signal, which is latent in user-item interactions to reveal the behavioral similarity between users (or items). \n",
    "\n",
    "**GCNs can be used to encode the interaction signal in the embeddings**. Interacted items can be seen as user´s features, because they provide direct evidence on a user’s preference. Similarly, the users that consume an item can be treated as the item’s features and used to measure the collaborative similarity of two items. A natural way to incorporate the interaction signal in the embedding is by exploiting the high-order connectivity from user-item interactions.\n",
    "\n",
    "In the figure below, the user-item interaction is shown (to the left) as well as the concept of higher-order connectivity (to the right).\n",
    "\n",
    "<img src=\"https://recodatasets.z20.web.core.windows.net/images/High_order_connectivity.png\" width=500 style=\"display:block; margin-left:auto; margin-right:auto;\">\n",
    "\n",
    "The high-order connectivity shows the collaborative signal in a graph form. For example, the path $u_1 ← i_2 ← u2$ indicates the behavior\n",
    "similarity between $u_1$ and $u_2$, as both users have interacted with $i_2$; the longer path $u_1 ← i_2 ← u_2 ← i_4$ suggests that $u_1$ is likely to adopt $i_4$, since her similar user $u_2$ has consumed $i_4$ before. Moreover, from the holistic view of $l = 3$, item $i_4$ is more likely to be of interest to $u_1$ than item $i_5$, since there are two paths connecting $(i_4,u_1)$, while only one path connects $(i_5,u_1)$.\n",
    "\n",
    "Based on this high-order connectivity, NGCF [4] defines an embedding propagation layer, which refines a user’s (or an item’s) embedding by aggregating the embeddings of the interacted items (or users). By stacking multiple embedding propagation layers, we can enforce the embeddings\n",
    "to capture the collaborative signal in high-order connectivities.\n",
    "\n",
    "More formally, let $\\mathbf{e}_{u}^{0}$ denote the original embedding of user $u$ and $\\mathbf{e}_{i}^{0}$ denote the original embedding of item $i$. The embedding propagation can be computed recursively as:\n",

    "\n",
    "To obtain the final representation, each propagated embedding is concatenated (i.e., $\\mathbf{e}_{u}^{(*)}=\\mathbf{e}_{u}^{(0)}||...||\\mathbf{e}_{u}^{(l)}$), and then the final user's preference over an item is computed as a dot product: $\\hat y_{u i} = \\mathbf{e}_{u}^{(*)T}\\mathbf{e}_{i}^{(*)}$.\n",

In the layer combination step, instead of concatenating the embeddings, we sum over the embeddings at each layer to obtain the final representations.\n",
    "\n",
    "### 1.3 Light Graph Convolution (LGC)\n",
    "\n",
    "In LightGCN, we adopt the simple weighted sum aggregator and abandon the use of feature transformation and nonlinear activation. The graph convolution operation in LightGCN is defined as:\n",

    "The symmetric normalization term $\\frac{1}{\\sqrt{\\left|\\mathcal{N}_{u}\\right|} \\sqrt{\\left|\\mathcal{N}_{i}\\right|}}$ follows the design of standard GCN, which can avoid the scale of embeddings increasing with graph convolution operations.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "### 1.4 Layer Combination and Model Prediction\n",
    "\n",
    "In LightGCN, the only trainable model parameters are the embeddings at the 0-th layer, i.e., $\\mathbf{e}_{u}^{(0)}$ for all users and $\\mathbf{e}_{i}^{(0)}$ for all items. When they are given, the embeddings at higher layers can be computed via LGC. After $K$ layers LGC, we further combine the embeddings obtained at each layer to form the final representation of a user (an item):\n",

    "\\mathbf{e}_{u}=\\sum_{k=0}^{K} \\alpha_{k} \\mathbf{e}_{u}^{(k)} ; \\quad \\mathbf{e}_{i}=\\sum_{k=0}^{K} \\alpha_{k} \\mathbf{e}_{i}^{(k)}\n",
    "$$\n",
    "\n",
    "where $\\alpha_{k} \\geq 0$ denotes the importance of the $k$-th layer embedding in constituting the final embedding. In our experiments, we set $\\alpha_{k}$ uniformly as $1 / (K+1)$.\n",
    "\n",
    "The model prediction is defined as the inner product of user and item final representations:\n",

    "Let the user-item interaction matrix be $\\mathbf{R} \\in \\mathbb{R}^{M \\times N}$ where $M$ and $N$ denote the number of users and items, respectively, and each entry $R_{ui}$ is 1 if $u$ has interacted with item $i$ otherwise 0. We then obtain the adjacency matrix of the user-item graph as\n",

Because SAR generates recommendations based on user preferences, all users that are in the test set must also exist in the training set. For this case, we can use the provided `python_stratified_split` function which holds out a percentage (in this case 25%) of items from each user, but ensures all users are in both `train` and `test` datasets. Other options are available in the `dataset.python_splitters` module which provide more control over how the split occurs."
